<ol>
	<li>the necessary firewall on the N side which necessitates lack of ventilation and hence a (higher R value and more expensive) solid vapor free roof. Or ventilation from inside.
	</li>

	<li>
	How far (and if) South the south wall can be pushed w/o triggering the need for a firewall. At least some glazing is needed here. Assumed a 4 foot extension here.
	<ol type=a>
		<li>
		if firewall  then top solar cavity can be slanted like a roof and keep its glazing. The subtracted % can be used as glazing on the domicile.
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
	Cost of the whole structure may necessitate in drastically reducing the basement eg eliminating the garage door entrance and cutting the floor space by 1/3. i would prefer not to do this but to salvage the house i may have to.
	<ol type=a>
		<li>
	The "garage door" is mostly in the shut position though and should be well insulated even though it means sveral minutes of undoing the insulation.
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
	Another cost cutting measure is to eliminate all bathrooms except the one required by code - leaving plumbing and electrical stubs for filling later.
	<ol type=a>
		<li>
		the W/D area just needs the plumbing (H, C & Gray)
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
	Generally the plumbing, electrical, audio, computer signal lines and the shell need to be in place, but much else can be stubbed out.
	</li>

	<li>
	One can raise the Hall up so its N upper corner is cut off. This gets height for either basement or hall or both - at the expense of area in the domicile.
	<ol type=a>
		<li>
		Change to the domicile:bathroom would protrude into the area penciled for largest, western most, storage ages.
		</li>
		<li>
		the volume could be structurally beneficial for shortening the Halls ceiling joists
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>

	<li>
	Steel cross beam(s) can go across hall and joists then run EW for  10 foot (3 beam - odd is best) spans. All these ceiling structures should be left open. (acoustic, visual, spatial and cost benefits).
	</li>

	<li>
	These can be closed/opened through to the hall by un/bundling floorboard cutouts
	</li>

	<li>
	Stove pipe, for "open" stove. If an open stove cannot be found pipe is still be installed in hope one such can be found. Chimney sited so as to optimize impact on storage area zero in domicile, eg sloped from corner.
	</li>

	<li>
	6" Steel pipe from about 10 feet in ground through to about 4 feet in solar attic, exactly under apex of solar roof.
	<ol type=a>
		<li>
		Could serve as mast for eggbeater windmill, flag etc.
		</li><li>
		Could serve as a shaft for elevator/dumbwaiter.
		</li><li>
		Could serve as a mechanical steadier for earthquake, eg with staircase as other post.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<li>
	Anchor/anvil/seat/bindu of whole house.
	</li>

	</li>
