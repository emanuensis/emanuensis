<p>Indeed it is getting detailed enough that it is becoming clearer what the deficits might be from my vision:-} For instance i am trying to figure out how an essential lynch pin of the design: Using various means to contribute to a hot water cistern which is then used to preheat water for various purposes such as heating the house and providing domestic hot water.
</p>
<p>Yesterdays shoot provided some of this (though it was flawed as my wide angle lens failed). But we can use it for an example of how to use the page's' software.
</p>
<p>When the page (~<a href="http://i.tgu.ca/bright_build_pics">bright_build_pics</a>) first opens up there is a thmBox, a set of controls a title and a brief explanation of how to operate its features. Depending on your screen size and possibly your stage of perusal you will want to resize components. The largest on screen element, the thmBox, can be resized either by
<ol>
	<li>clicking and dragging within it on a blank portion - ie rubberbanding it. This is easiest but may not be compatible with your browser</li>
	<li>using the Arrow keys</li>
	<li>clicking on the spots <b>^</b> <b>v</b> <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;</b>
	</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>One can see the thumbnails for yesterdays date (141015) by clicking its down arrow,
<span style="color:green;font-size:larger">&#x21B7;</span>,
which becomes an up arrow
<span style="color:red;font-size:larger">&#x21BB;</span>
(clicked again and those thumbs are rolled up)
</p>
<p>One can also change the size of all thumbnails by changing the value in, size:
<input type="text" value="77" style="background: pink; width:2em"/>
</p>
<p>The reason for the thumbs though is to chose full size images, or pics, which are accumulated below the interface bar. There they can be scrolled through, or all selected can all be flipped though in a movie like manor. Animation also make it possible to connect the large pics with their corresponding thumbs, so one can, eg, find out where it occurred in the timeline: just hover over a pic or a thumb and its opposite will respond.
</p>
<p>One can select from thumbnail images either by
<ol>
	<li>clicking on a thumb</li>
	<li>clicking on a date</li>
	<li>or by clicking <b style="color:black"><i style="color:red">A</i>LL?</b> (typing <i style="color:red">A</i>)</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>One can winnow pics out of those selected by clicking them... Or one can massively dismiss all clicking
<b style="color:black"><i style="color:red">C</i>learPics</b> (typing <i style="color:red">C</i>)
</p>
<p>
The sizes of the larger pics is set by PICsz:
<input type="text" value="755"
style="background: pink; width:2em"/>
(a negative value sets the old ones too).
</p>
<p>
Finally, once a selection is made, a movie can be started using that selection by pressing <b style="color:black"><i style="color:red">M</i>ovie?:</b> (typing <i style="color:red">M</i>). A good exercise for this capability is looking at the photos of August 21 (140821). Only about 1/4 the photos shot are used but the containers were put in then. So suddenly it went from 0% of the final volume (see 140818) to 40% in four hours! The camera was held fairly steady so it makes a fair movie of the placement of the fourth container.
